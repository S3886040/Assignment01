					<p>My name is Justin Healy, Student number S3886040, email - S3886040@student.rmit.edu.au.

            I love to run, work through my degree subjects with OUA and RMIT and keep fit and healthy
            through exercise and healthy eating. I recently moved back to Australia after spending 4 years
            living in Germany, arriving back just before the pandemic hit. The reason for the move was so my
            German Girlfriend and I could start an Australian life together after experiencing a life in Berlin,
            and so I could gain some higher education.

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>
            My interest in IT really gained some traction after completing a web development bootcamp in Berlin for 3 months.
            It was centred around some high-level java script, and gave me a great insight into the world of IT. Although it was
            not quite enough to gain employment as a developer in a very congested development world in Berlin, it was a great
            introduction to this degree in Info Tech.

            I chose to study with RMIT, because of the flexibility offered through OUA, as I can study it all remotely and online
            and fit it around work commitments. I expect, and hope, to further my knowledge of programming and web technologies,
            as well build a very deep understanding of computer systems and technologies in the modern world and for the future
            to come.

					<h2>Job Title</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51709728?type=standout#searchRequestToken=5264691a-4937-4566-ab78-a94ec5826173">
            https://www.seek.com.au/job/51709728?type=standout#searchRequestToken=5264691a-4937-4566-ab78-a94ec5826173</a></p>
					<h3>Why this position appeals to me</h3>
					<p>The position advertised appeals to me, as the role of a QA tester and analyst would challenge me intellectually.
            The role will demand complex solutions to simple problems, as I will be writing programs to test the program to
            ensure it remains robust and secure. It will challenge me creatively to seek out these solutions and place myself
            in the position of the user to find other potential bugs. </p>
					<h3>Skills Required for the Position</h3>
					<p>I will need a deep knowledge of programming across multiple languages and frame works, as well as a solid foundation
            in computing and development technologies.
            Further to this though I will also need to develop all my soft skills, as the position will require me bring together
            information from different departments to ensure the product is robust and thoroughly tested. Empathy will also be an
            important soft skill, as the position requires, and values, those who can walk in the shoes of others, with the
            creativity to imagine their behaviour while using the product I would need to test.
          </p>
					<h3>Skills required for the position I currently have</h3>
          <h4>Hard Skills</h4>
					<p>I currently have experience in web programming using primarily JavaScript, and have some spent some time using different
            java-script frameworks such as React, jQuery and Vue. Additionally, I have used databases to store and retrieve data from
            the apps I have worked with and the relevant html and CSS skills. However, a much deeper understanding of programming is
            needed, and I hope to find these skills through this RMIT degree.
          </p>
          <h4>Soft Skills</h4>
          <p>
            I worked for 3 years for a rental car company whilst living in Germany. This position helped me to develop some soft
            skills while working in their rental reservations department. I would speak with customers and place their reservations
            for them, and problem solve on their behalf when things went wrong. To resolve some situations, it was important to
            liaise with other departments to secure refunds, source important information and construct a solution to the issues
            they were experiencing.

        <article>
          <p>The Myer Briggs test results have indicated that I am quite Introverted, decisive, and empathic.
            My learning style, indicated by the Emtrain learning styles quiz, has been identified as mostly pragmatic
            and the big five personality test, provided by https://openpsychometrics.org/,  places me as mostly agreeable
            and conscientious.
          </p>
          <p>These traits are no surprise to me as I am aware of my introverted nature, and I manage this
              as necessary by keeping some time set aside for myself at least once per day. And although learning style tests
              can be very general. I would tend to agree that I am a practical learner. I can learn theoretically. However, I
              tend to hit a wall at some point and need to try things out to understand them fully.
          </p>
          <p>These traits will be useful through the group assignments as the personality test rates me as being very agreeable
            and conscientious. Meaning I am likely to listen to others point of view, and I will be organised and efficient
            with my conduct.

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>Have you ever wondered if the mail has arrived yet? Have you ever gone out to check the mail, only to find that
            there is nothing there? Well, my project idea aims to solve this problem. When the mail arrives, you will receive
            a notification on your mobile that “you’ve got mail”, hopefully in that very 90’s computer voice made famous by
            Meg Ryan and Tom hanks’ film You’ve got mail. The invention includes an app, downloadable on both Android and
            iPhone, which will notify you when the mail arrives and log the date and time it arrived.
          </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>There are products on the market like this. This is not a new idea or invention. But my adaptation is a learning
            project making use of some great technologies and integrating them in a new way. And some other products will
            require connection to a smart hub, or they will relay your data/mail notifications through private server
            infrastructure then send out notifications with their apps. My solution will be directly connected to our home
            wi-fi network, and we will be programming what is sent to the cloud, so we can be sure what is being stored in
            remote databases.
          </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The mail detector will utilise several pieces of hardware working together to make this work. We will have an
            Arduino Nano 33 IoT, a magnetic door sensor and USB power supply. We will place the hardware into the letterbox
            placing one half of the door sensor on any movable part of the letter box and other half fixed to a non-moveable
            piece. If there are no moveable parts, a plate can placed at the back of the chute with hinges which will open
            when pressure is creating by the delivery of the daily mail. The Arduino Nano and power supply will remain inside
            the, hopefully locked, letter box and connected to your Wi-Fi. The basic function of the device is when the mail
            door cute is opened the magnetic door sensor ‘seal’ will be broken we will then program the Arduino to update the
            cloud that the mail has arrived creating an event stored in their servers. This event will then be available for
            the mobile app to access.
          </p>
          <p>The second part is the mobile app we create, to check to see if the mail has arrived. There is the basic function
            of the app which would/could be a button that says, ‘Check Mail’. And when you click the button, an API is sent
            to the server to see if the mail has arrived today. But there are some layers we can add to this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first layer we can add is a history of all the dates and times the mail arrives. We could simply add a button
            which will then render a screen showing all, or at least the last 30 days of mail times and dates of arrival.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second layer could be a notification feature which would notify the user when the mail arrives. Alerting them
            so they can go and retrieve it.
          </p>
				</article>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>As specified above we will have the Arduino Nano. Which was chosen as an appropriate piece of hardware because of
            its simplicity but also because of its capability. Namely its wi-fi capability. Using this we can connect directly
            to a server to store our events. And this creates a much larger scope for this project as we can then connect
            devices any where in the world. We can in theory, check the mail while in Japan. Without independent wi-fi
            connection we would be limited to local connection on our own network. And Arduinos cloud system offers a simple
            cloud storage solution with API integration. And is also free to get started.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also need a magnetic door seal, and power supply. A generic brand electronic door seal would be appropriate,
            and any USB power supply will work. However, the longer the battery life the better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software wise, we will need the Arduino IDE to develop the code which will send the events and relevant details
            to the cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            And to develop the mobile app which the user will interact with. We could use React Native. Which would then make
            it a cross platform application, being compatible on both Android and iPhone. This would be extra useful if this
            ever became commercially viable.
          </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Firstly, we would need a solid understanding of the Arduino coding library. This is their custom code library
            they designed for ease of use to function along side their hardware and is integrated in into the Arduino
            Integrated Development Environment (IDE). And we would need to learn how this library is compatible with API
            integration. Next, we would need to learn React Native, so we could code up the user facing app.
          </p>
          <p>
            These skills are very attainable. The Arduino coding library is designed for ease of use and for beginners to
            learn coding alongside hardware integration. So, this would be a learning curve however very doable.
            React Native, on the other hand, is a bit more complex and would require a lot of time to learn. But our app
            is quite basic and the functionality beyond the API integration is quite simple.
          </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>Hopefully as an outcome for this project and all our hard work, we will have a piece of tech which will make
            our lives slightly easier. Which is the purpose of most modern technology. But also, since this is a build
            project, we would have all the knowledge we gained from building this from start to finish.
